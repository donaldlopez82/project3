// addOne / addMany: add new items to the state
// upsertOne / upsertMany: add new items or update existing ones
// updateOne / updateMany: update existing items by supplying partial values
// removeOne / removeMany: remove items based on IDs
// setAll: replace all existing items
//
// We also get:
// getInitialState: returns an object that looks like { ids: [], entities: {} },
// for storing a normalized state of items along with an array of all item IDs
// getSelectors: generates a standard set of selector functions
